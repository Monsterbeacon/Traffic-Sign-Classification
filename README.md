**Traffic Sign Classification Using Deep Neural Networks**  

**Objective**:  
Develop a robust traffic sign classification system to enhance traffic safety and support advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS).  

**Overview**:  
- Implemented a deep neural network model using a dataset with 48 traffic sign classes.  
- Utilized key libraries such as **TensorFlow**, **Keras**, and **scikit-learn**.  
- Designed a **CNN** architecture with layers including 2D convolution, max pooling, dropout, and dense layers.  

**Results**:  
- Achieved promising classification accuracy and minimized model loss.  
- Aimed to reduce traffic accidents through real-time detection and classification for smart vehicles.  

**Challenges and Future Scope**:  
Faced challenges in model generalization and computational overhead, which can be mitigated by hyperparameter tuning and data augmentation. Potential for deployment in real-world ADAS systems.
